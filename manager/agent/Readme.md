# QVP: CXL Remote Development

## Overview

QVP (Quick Virtualization Platform) is a tool designed to facilitate remote development environments using Docker containers.
It provides a web-based interface to manage and interact with development instances, allowing users to start, stop, and monitor
their containers. The platform also integrates with code-server for web-based IDE access, SSH for terminal access, and SPICE for
remote desktop access.

## Features

- **Container Management**: Start, stop, restart, and remove Docker containers.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time CPU and memory usage statistics.
- **Web-based IDE**: Access to a code-server instance for web-based development.
- **SSH Access**: Direct SSH access to the guest OS running inside the container.
- **Remote Desktop**: SPICE protocol support for remote desktop access.
- **User Isolation**: Each user gets their own isolated environment with unique ports and directories.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running on the host machine.
- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`).
